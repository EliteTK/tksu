Project information:
====================
This is a set of Garry's Mod server utilities. Feel free to use them.
This project will end up as an expansion of ULX - maybe one day it might end up merged.
This is an attempt of creating some additional utilities that I feel ulx lacks. It will hopefully eventually incorporate a user accessible log window that shows all the events ulx logs. This will also allow for a visual representation of certain events such as kills.
Another idea is to add some server protection FPP lacks. I have been made aware of a quick and easy way to take down Garry's Mod servers running certain maps ( and even ones running other maps ) which involves abusing the fact that Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox.
There are also problems regarding the fact that certain servers don't want people to easily exploit such things as propkilling. Certain servers simply do not need the ability to simulate props being thrown at people.
In the end, I am to also make this expandable and modular which will mean that you can select parts of the addon you wish to use, or add your own parts.
